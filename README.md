# Habbo Gif Transparency Fixer

A short little tool that changes the transparency layer of a .gif file to have the RGB values of 255,255,255 instead of 0,0,0 to fix transparency in Habbo Shockwave client versions. No tools expose this easily through any existing image editing API, so we edit the bytes of the .gif itself.
